/**
 * Leaf stripBOM — extracted from json.ts to break settings → json → log →
 * types/logs → … → settings. json.ts imports this for its memoized+logging
 * safeParseJSON; leaf callers that can't import json.ts use stripBOM +
 * jsonParse inline (syncCacheState does this).
 *
 * UTF-8 BOM (U+FEFF): PowerShell 5.x writes UTF-8 with BOM by default
 * (Out-File, Set-Content). We can't control user environments, so strip on
 * read. Without this, JSON.parse fails with "Unexpected token".
