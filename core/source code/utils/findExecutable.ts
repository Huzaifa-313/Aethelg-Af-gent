/**
 * Find an executable by searching PATH, similar to `which`.
 * Replaces spawn-rx's findActualExecutable to avoid pulling in rxjs (~313 KB).
 *
 * Returns { cmd, args } to match the spawn-rx API shape.
 * `cmd` is the resolved path if found, or the original name if not.
 * `args` is always the pass-through of the input args.
