## 🧪 Contribution Required


### End-to-End Environment Testing

- We are actively looking for contributors to validate Parse-OS automation across **different operating systems, hardware setups, and environments**.

- Instead of predefined unit tests, contributors will execute **real OS-level automation workflows** and report results.

👉 The full execution process, tooling, and reporting workflow are described in the **End-to-End Test Execution – Parse-OS** section below.

# End-to-End Test Execution – Parse-OS

This Section explains how to manually execute real OS-level automation flows in Parse-OS.

> These are NOT unit tests.
> They are real OS-level execution validations.

## 🧪 Using `agents_testing.py`


### File Location

```
os_automation/tests/agents_testing.py
```

### How to Run

From project root:

```
PYTHONPATH=parse-os python3 -m parse-os.tests.agents_testing
```

### This script allows contributors to:

- Provide a natural language instruction
- Capture current screen state
- Pass screenshot to Orchestrator
- Execute automation workflow

## 🎥 You can follow the step-by-step execution walkthrough here:

>  **[Test Execution Walkthrough Video – Parse-OS](https://youtu.be/aEsTHG5_Vf8)**

### If you are testing by following the video:

- Duplicate the provided [Test Case Reporting Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GXh1E_0dnz-w2zWnyath26RlVSZmbo4dymnuDVxKgcU/edit?usp=sharing).
- Execute the test cases shown in the video.
- Continuously update your duplicated sheet with execution results.
- When creating a Pull Request, include the link to your duplicated test case sheet in the PR description.

This ensures proper validation and execution traceability.
