## NOTE 
We’re still preparing for our **internally tested Alpha release** — the system isn’t production-ready yet.
Our **initial internal release** was made on **18 Oct 2025**, and we plan to roll out **four revisions** before alpha release become available for public testing.

# ParseOS  
**Open-source automation with purpose.**

---

## Description  
ParseOS is an open-source initiative to advance automation at the OS level.  
We do not pay for research; instead, our focus is on creating value by helping students and professionals start strong in data science and machine learning.  
Our goal is to foster a positive shift in tech through collaboration and shared learning.

---

## 🎯 Goals
Below are the broad technical and community goals of the OS Automation project.  
Our focus is to build a smooth, flexible, and cost-effective automation system that can be confidently used in production environments while staying open-source and community-driven.

1. Build Smooth & Production-Ready Automation  
Our first and foremost goal is to make operating system automation as smooth and reliable as possible.  
We focus on using open-source solutions and tools that work efficiently in real-world, production-level systems — not just prototypes or demos.

2. Create a Flexible & Extensible Architecture  
We design the system architecture to be highly modular and flexible, allowing easy integration or replacement of components.  
This makes it simple to adopt new popular tools, MCP-based solutions, or open-source alternatives in the future without breaking the existing system.

3. Keep It Cost-Effective and Scalable  
A key goal is to make the system cost-efficient without compromising performance.  
We aim to reduce unnecessary API calls, heavy dependencies, and overhead so that users can run automation tasks at low operational cost while still being scalable for production use.

4. Ensure Cross-Platform Compatibility  
OS Automation is built with the goal of supporting multiple operating systems and environments.  
Whether users are on Linux, macOS, or Windows, our target is to deliver consistent behavior and easy setup across all supported platforms.

5. Strengthen Testing & Reliability  
We aim to include robust testing, logging, and validation mechanisms to ensure each automation command behaves predictably.  
Error handling and retry logic are part of our core design to make the system production-ready and self-healing.

6. Improve Developer Experience & Documentation  
We want every developer to get started easily.  
Comprehensive documentation, clear examples, and simple “getting started” commands are part of our ongoing goal to make automation beginner-friendly and transparent.

7. Build an Open Community  
Our long-term vision includes growing an open developer community that collaborates, contributes new automation modules, and improves the ecosystem together.  
Open collaboration ensures that OS Automation evolves through shared knowledge, transparency, and innovation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started, just run the following command in your terminal:

```
python -m os_automation.cli.cli run "open browser and search for python tutorials"
```

What it does:
This command automatically opens your browser and searches for Python tutorials — helping you start learning Python right away!


### ⚠️ Known Limitations & Setup Challenges

- Automation may **not work out of the box** on new systems due to missing OS-level permissions, display access, or required dependencies.

- Some automation flows rely on **resource-heavy local models or system components**. Performance may degrade on lower-end systems or machines without CUDA support.  

- Setting up **vision libraries**, and **system-level dependencies** can be challenging on fresh machines  
  (e.g., CUDA/driver mismatches, PyTorch version conflicts, missing OpenCV system libs, Java/Sikuli bridge not available)

- **Cross-OS and UI variability** can impact automation due to differences in filesystem paths, shortcuts, window focus, load timing, screen scaling, themes, or unexpected system dialogs across Windows, Linux, and macOS.


Step-by-Step (for Beginners)

1. Clone this repository to your system using:
   ```
   git clone <repo_url>
   ```
2. Make sure Python is installed on your computer.

3. Open your terminal or command prompt.

4. Navigate into the cloned project folder.

5. Run the following command:
   ```
   python -m os_automation.cli.cli run "open browser and search for python tutorials"
   ```
6. **Press Enter**, and the automation will take care of the rest! 🎉

## 🏗️ Architecture – How It’s Built

- Three AI Agents — (Main Planner, Executor, Validator)  
- Task Abstraction Layer (TAL) — the shared contract schema between all agents  
- Adapters — thin wrappers that let you plug in any repo or model without rewriting the system  
- Registry — keeps track of which adapters are available  

- It stays open and modular, allowing seamless integration with popular automation repositories, MCP-native tools, and visual automation frameworks such as Sikuli and pyautogui.

- **Is future-proof (ready to integrate new tools easily).**

## 🌉 Where is it going next? The "Physical-OS" Bridge


We are initiating lean R&D efforts to bridge Agentic AI with physical environments. Our goal is to move beyond the screen and explore how ParseOS can orchestrate real-world data and hardware.

### Expertise-First Priority

- Our primary mission is to develop deep industry expertise. By combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Agentic Workflows, we are training our system to interpret complex technical manuals and translate them into actionable automation steps.

### The "OPC UA" Protocol Research

- We are investigating the OPC UA Bridge as a software-defined gateway. This research focuses on how an AI Agent can browse address spaces and interact with industrial data nodes without requiring expensive proprietary middleware.

### Simulation-Led Robotics (ROS 2)

- To remain cost-effective, our ROS 2 research begins in virtual simulation environments. We are exploring how ParseOS can act as a high-level task-planner, sending commands to simulated robotic nodes before graduating to low-cost, open-source hardware prototypes.

### Lightweight Edge Gateways (MQTT)

- We are researching MQTT-based telemetry pipelines to transform ParseOS into an intelligent edge gateway. Our focus is on using low-cost microcontrollers to feed real-time sensor data into our RAG system for instant anomaly detection and reporting.
